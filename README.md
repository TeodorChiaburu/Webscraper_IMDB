# Webscraper_IMDB

The program scrapes data about the current top 100 most popular movies on IMDB. We are particularly interested in year of appearance, IMDB score, increase/decrease in popularity and number of votes; this information is stored in a csv file (see [imdb_top100.csv](imdb_top100.csv) as an example).

## Tasks

  - [object diagram](proofs/uml_objektdiagramm.png): shows the values of the attributes of the object *webscraper* after being instantiated
  - [use case diagram](proofs/uml_anwendungsfalldiagramm.png): shows how the script runs and what the expected result is
